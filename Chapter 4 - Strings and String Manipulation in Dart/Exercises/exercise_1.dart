// Exercise 1: Palindrome Checker

// Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. 

// A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when determining if a string is a palindrome.
