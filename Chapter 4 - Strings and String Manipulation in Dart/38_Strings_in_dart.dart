  // String Datatype 

  /*
    Strings in Dart are used to represent sequences of characters. They are used to store and manipulate textual data. In Dart, strings are immutable, which means once a string is created, it cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings by performing various string operations.
  */

  // To define a string literal in Dart, you can use either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). 
  // Here are some examples:

  String name = 'Muhammad Arslan'; // Using single quotes
  String message = "Hello, Dart!"; // Using double quotes
  String quote = 'He said, "I love Dart!"'; // Using quotes within quotes

  // You can also print these string variables

  print(name);
  print(message);
  print(quote);

  // We can check the length of each string easily by using length property

  print("name variable length is ${name.length}");
  print("message variable length is ${message.length}");
  print("quote variable length is ${quote.length}");
