  3. Use string formatting to display the word frequency count in a tabular format.

  This projects will provide you with practical exercises to apply your knowledge of operators, expressions, strings, string manipulation, and string formatting in Dart. They will help reinforce your understanding of these concepts and enhance your programming skills.
