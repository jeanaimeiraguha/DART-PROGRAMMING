  Project Topic: String Encryption
  
  Write a program that takes a string as input and encrypts it using a simple encryption algorithm. The encryption algorithm works as follows:

  1. Replace each character in the string with its corresponding ASCII value.
  2. Reverse the resulting string.
  3. Add a special character '#' at the beginning and end of the reversed string.
  
  Example:
  Input: "Hello"
  Output: "#111#101#108#108#111#"

  Requirements:

  1. Implement the encryption algorithm using operators and expressions.
  
  2. Perform string manipulation to convert characters to their ASCII values and reverse the string.
  
  3. Use string formatting to add the special character '#' at the beginning and end of the reversed string.
  
  4. This exercise will help you practice using operators and expressions to perform calculations, string manipulation to transform and reverse strings, and string formatting to achieve a specific output format.
