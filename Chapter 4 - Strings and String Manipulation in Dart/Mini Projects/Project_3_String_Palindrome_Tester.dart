  Project 3: String Palindrome Tester
  
  Write a program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. Ignore spaces, punctuation marks, and case sensitivity when determining if a string is a palindrome. Print the result indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not.

  Requirements:

  1. Utilize operators and expressions to remove spaces and punctuation marks from the input string.
  
  2. Perform string manipulation to convert the string to lowercase and reverse it.
  
  3. Use string formatting to print the result indicating whether the input string is a palindrome or not.


  This project will provide you with practical exercises to apply your knowledge of operators, expressions, strings, string manipulation, and string formatting in Dart. They will help reinforce your understanding of these concepts and enhance your programming skills.
