  Project 3: Word Game

  You are developing a word game where players need to guess words. Implement the following tasks using Dart lists:

  1. Create an empty list called wordList.

  2. Prompt the user to enter five words one by one and add them to the wordList.

  3. Shuffle the wordList to change the order of the words.

  4. Display the shuffled wordList to the user.

  5. Sort the wordList in reverse alphabetical order and display the sorted list.

  6. Ask the user to guess a word and check if it exists in the wordList. Display the result.

  7. Display the length of each word in the wordList to the user.

  8. Remove the word with the shortest length from the wordList.

  9. Display the final version of the wordList.
