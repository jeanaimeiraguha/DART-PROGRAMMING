      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ]

  2. Display the matrix to the user.

  3. Calculate and display the sum of all the elements in the matrix.

  4. Find the maximum value in the matrix and display it.

  5. Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns) and display the transposed matrix.

  6. Multiply each element in the matrix by 2 and display the updated matrix.
