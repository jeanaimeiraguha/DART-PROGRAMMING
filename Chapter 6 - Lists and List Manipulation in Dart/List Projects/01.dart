  Project 1: Student Scores

  You are tasked with creating a program to manage student scores. Implement the following tasks using Dart lists:

  1. Create an empty list called studentScores.

  2. Prompt the user to enter the scores of five students one by one. Add each score to the studentScores list.

  3. Calculate and display the average score of the students in the class.

  4. Find and display the highest score in the class.

  5. Find and display the lowest score in the class.

  6. Sort the studentScores list in ascending order.

  7. Create a new list called topScorers that contains the top three scores from the studentScores list.

  8. Remove the lowest score from the topScorers list.

  9. Prompt the user to enter the score of a new student and add it to the studentScores list.

  10. Update the topScorers list with the three highest scores, including the score of the new student.

  11. Display the final studentScores list and the topScorers list.

  Ensure that your program handles different scenarios gracefully, such as invalid input or a smaller number of scores than expected.

  This assignment allows students to practice creating and manipulating lists in Dart, as well as performing calculations and sorting operations. It also encourages problem-solving and logical thinking. Feel free to adapt or modify the assignment to fit the specific needs and level of your students.
