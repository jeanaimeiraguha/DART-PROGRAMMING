  // Iterable or Iterator

  // Dart provides an Iterable interface that can be used to iterate over the elements of a list. 
  // Let me explain it to you:


  // 1. Iterable: The Iterable interface represents a sequence of values that can be iterated or looped over. It provides methods for traversing and manipulating the elements of a collection.

  // Here's an example of using an iterable to iterate over the elements of a list:

  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Using a for-in loop to iterate over the elements
  for (int number in numbers) {
    print(number);
  }

  // Using the forEach() method with a callback function
  numbers.forEach((number) {
    print(number);
  });


  // Both the for-in loop and the forEach() method allow you to iterate over the elements of the list.

  // 2. Iterator: The Iterator class is used internally by iterables to provide a way to access the elements sequentially. It is not directly accessed when iterating over a list using a for-in loop or the forEach() method.

  // However, if you need more control over the iteration process, you can use the Iterator class directly. Here's an example:

  List<int> numberss = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  Iterator<int> iterator = numberss.iterator;

  while (iterator.moveNext()) {
    int number = iterator.current;
    print(number);
  }

  // In this example, we obtain an iterator from the list using the iterator property. We then use the moveNext() method to move to the next element and the current property to access the current element.

  // It's important to note that in most cases, using a for-in loop or the forEach() method is more convenient and idiomatic for iterating over the elements of a list in Dart.
