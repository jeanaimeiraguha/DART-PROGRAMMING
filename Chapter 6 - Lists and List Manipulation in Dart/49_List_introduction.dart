  ******** List Introduction ********

    In this chapter, we will explore the concept of lists in Dart, understand their purpose and usage with real-life examples. We will also learn about the two types of lists in Dart: growable lists and fixed-length lists.

  
  ******** What is a List? ********

    A list is an ordered collection of items in Dart. It allows you to store and manipulate multiple values of different types under a single variable name and access them by their index.


  ******** Index: ********

    Each element has its index number that tells the element position in the list. The index number is used to access the particular element from the list, such as list_name[index]. 
    
    The list indexing starts from 0 to length-1 where length denotes the numbers of the element present in the list. For example, - The length of the above list is 4.


  ******** Usage of Lists with Real-Life Examples: ********

    Imagine you have a shopping list where you need to keep track of various items you want to buy. You can use a list to store all the items in a structured and ordered manner.
    
    Similarly, you can use a list to store a series of student names, temperatures recorded throughout a day, or any other set of related data.


  ******** Types of Lists in Dart: ********

    Dart provides two types of lists: fixed-length lists and growable lists.

    1. Growable List
    2. Fixed Length List



  ******** Growable List: ********

    A growable list is a dynamic list that can change its size dynamically during runtime.
    It can grow or shrink based on the number of items you add or remove from it.



  ******** Fixed-Length List: ********

    A fixed-length list is a list with a predetermined size that cannot change once defined.
    It has a fixed number of elements that you specify when creating the list.
