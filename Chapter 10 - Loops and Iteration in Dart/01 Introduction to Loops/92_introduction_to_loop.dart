// Introduction to Loops:

// Loops are an essential concept in programming that allow us to repeatedly execute a block of code based on a certain condition or for a specified number of times. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and make programs more efficient and flexible. Loops provide a way to iterate over a collection of data or perform a specific action until a particular condition is met.


// Benefits of using loops in programming:


// 1. Efficiency: Loops help reduce code redundancy by executing a block of code multiple times, eliminating the need to write the same code repeatedly.

// 2. Automation: Loops automate repetitive tasks, making the program more efficient and less error-prone.

// 3. Flexibility: Loops provide the flexibility to iterate over a collection of data and perform actions dynamically based on the current iteration.

// 4. Scalability: Loops allow programs to handle large amounts of data by processing each element systematically.

// 5. Code Readability: By using loops, programmers can write concise and readable code that is easy to understand and maintain.
