It allows developers to write, run, and experiment with Dart code directly in the web browser without the need for any local setup or installation. DartPad provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface where developers can quickly prototype, test, and share their Dart code snippets or small programs.

  With DartPad, you can write Dart code in the editor, and the results of the code execution are immediately displayed in the output area.
