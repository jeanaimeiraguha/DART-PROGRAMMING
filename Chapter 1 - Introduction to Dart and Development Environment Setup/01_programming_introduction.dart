// What is Programming 

/*
  Programming is the process of creating sets of instructions (called code) that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It involves writing logical instructions using a programming language to solve problems or automate tasks. These instructions are executed by a computer or other programmable devices to produce the desired output.

  Programmers use programming languages like Dart, Python, Java, C++, and many others to write code. They break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks and write instructions to solve each part. The code typically consists of variables, data structures, control structures (like loops and conditionals), functions or methods, and other programming constructs.

  Programming allows you to create software applications, websites, games, mobile apps, and much more. It is a fundamental skill in today's digital world and is used in various industries such as software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, web development, and scientific research.

  Programming requires logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. It involves not only writing code but also debugging, testing, and maintaining the codebase. Good programming practices include writing clean and efficient code, following coding standards, and collaborating with others using version control systems.

  Overall, programming empowers you to create solutions, automate tasks, and build innovative applications by leveraging the capabilities of computers and software. It is a powerful tool for turning ideas into reality and has a wide range of applications in various domains.
