  ***** What is a Map? *****

    A map is a collection of key-value pairs in Dart. It is also known as an associative array, dictionary, or hash table in other programming languages. Maps provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on a unique key.

    Key-Value Pairs:

    In a map, each element consists of a key and its corresponding value. The key acts as a unique identifier or index for the associated value. The key-value pairs are stored together and can be accessed using the key. Keys must be unique within a map, while values can be of any type.


    
  ***** Characteristics of sets: *****

    1. Uniqueness: Each key in a map must be unique. Duplicate keys are not allowed, and attempting to add a key that already exists will replace the previous value associated with that key.

    2. Order: The order of elements in a map is not guaranteed. Maps are not inherently ordered like lists.

    3. Dynamic Size: Maps in Dart can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

    4. Flexibility: Keys and values in a map can be of different types. For example, the key can be a string, and the value can be an integer or an object.

    5. Efficient Lookup: Maps provide fast and efficient lookup of values based on their associated keys. This makes maps suitable for scenarios where quick access to data is required.


    The key-value pair structure of maps allows for efficient data retrieval and storage. Maps are commonly used to represent data structures such as dictionaries, configurations, database records, and more. They provide a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating data in Dart applications.

    In the upcoming sections, we will explore how to create and manipulate maps, access their elements, and leverage the features and methods provided by the Dart language to work with maps effectively.
