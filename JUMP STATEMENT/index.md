In Dart, jump statements are used to transfer control from one part of the code to another. Dart has three main types of jump statements: break, continue, and return. Each of these serves different purposes in loops and functions.




break Statement
The break statement is used to exit a loop (like for, while, or do-while) or a switch case prematurely. It stops the loop immediately and transfers control to the code that follows the loop.





continue Statement
The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration and jump to the next iteration. It doesn't exit the loop but skips the rest of the code for that cycle.



3. return Statement
The return statement is used to exit a function and optionally return a value. It stops the functionâ€™s execution and returns control to the calling code.
