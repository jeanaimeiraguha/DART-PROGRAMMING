  Built-in Functions:

  Built-in functions are pre-defined functions that are provided by the Dart language or libraries. They are readily available for you to use without requiring any additional setup or configuration. Built-in functions provide common functionalities and utility operations. Here are a few examples of built-in functions in Dart:

  print(): Prints the specified message to the console.
  sqrt(): Computes the square root of a given number.
  toUpperCase(): Converts a string to uppercase.
  sort(): Sorts a list in ascending order.
  toString(): Converts an object to its string representation.

  Built-in functions are part of the Dart language or external libraries. They are typically documented, and you can readily use them by calling their names and providing the required arguments.

  It's important to note that Dart also supports higher-order functions and closures. Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as parameters or return functions as results. Closures are functions that can access and modify variables from their surrounding scope.

  When programming in Dart, you have the flexibility to create your own functions to address specific needs while utilizing the built-in functions available in the language or libraries to leverage existing functionality and optimize development efforts.


  Now we can briefly discuss user-defined functions first then will talk about built-in Functions.
