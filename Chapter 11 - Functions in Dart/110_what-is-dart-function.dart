  ***** Dart Function *****
	
  Dart function is a set of codes that together perform a specific task. It is used to break the large code into smaller modules and reuse it when needed. Functions make the program more readable and easy to debug. It improves the modular approach and enhances the code reusability.

  Suppose, we write a simple calculator program where we need to perform operations number of times when the user enters the values. We can create different functions for each calculator operator. By using these functions, we don't need to write code for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing again and again. We can use the functions multiple times by calling.

  The function provides the flexibility to run a code several times with different values. A function can be called anytime as its parameter and returns some value to where it is called.

  The few benefits of the Dart function are given below.

  1. It increases the module approach to solve the problems.
  2. It enhances the re-usability of the program.
  3. We can do the coupling of the programs.
  4. It optimizes the code.
  5. It makes debugging easier.
  6. It makes development easy and creates less complexity.
