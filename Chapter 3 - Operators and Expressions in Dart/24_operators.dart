  // What are Operators?

  /*
    In programming, operators are symbols or special characters that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables). They allow you to perform various computations, comparisons, assignments, and other manipulations in your code.
  */

  // Operators serve different purposes depending on their types.


  // What is an expression ?
  /*
    An expression is a special kind of statement that evaluates to a value. Every expression is composed of −

    Operands − Represents the data

    Operator − Defines how the operands will be processed to produce a value.

    Consider the following expression – "2 + 3". In this expression, 2 and 3 are operands and the symbol "+" (plus) is the operator

  /*
    In this chapter, we will discuss the operators that are available in Dart.

  1. Unary Operator

    unary postfix	          expr++    expr--    ()      []        ?[]    .    ?.    !
    unary prefix	          -expr    !expr    ~expr    ++expr    --expr      await expr

  2. Arithmetic Operators

    multiplicative	          *         /       %       ~/	      Left
    additive	                +         -	
    shift	                    <<        >>      >>>	

  3. Bitwise Operator

    bitwise AND	              &
    bitwise XOR	              ^
    bitwise OR	              | 

  4. Equality and Relational Operators 

    relational and type test	>=    >    <=    <    as    is    is!	
    equality	                ==    !=   	

  5. logical Operator

    logical AND               &&
    logical OR	              ||

  6. Null Aware Operator

    if null	                  ??

  7. conditional Operator

    conditional	              expr1 ? expr2 : expr3	
  
  8. Null Aware Access Operator

    cascade	                  ..    ?..	

  9. Assignment Operator

    assignment	              =    *=    /=   +=   -=   &=   ^=   etc.
