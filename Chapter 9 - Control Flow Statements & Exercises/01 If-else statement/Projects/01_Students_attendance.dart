// Student Attendance Tracker:

// Description

// The Student Attendance Tracker project is designed to help users efficiently track and manage the attendance of multiple students. It provides a convenient console-based interface to record and monitor students' attendance for each class session.


// Requirements:

// 1. The project should allow the user to track the attendance of multiple students.
// 2. Each student's attendance can be represented as a map, where the student's name is the key and the attendance record (stored in a list or set) is the value.
// 3. The project should provide options for marking students as present or absent for each class session.
// 4. It should calculate and display the percentage of attendance for each student.
// 5. Additionally, the project can generate reports, such as a list of students with low attendance or a summary of overall class attendance.
// 6. If-else statements can be used to check for specific conditions, such as notifying students with consecutive absences or rewarding students with high attendance.
