// Quiz Game:


// Requirements:

// The project should implement a quiz game where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive scores.
// The questions and answer choices can be stored in a map or a list of maps.
// The project should provide options for selecting a quiz category, such as sports, history, science, etc., and generating random questions from that category.
// It should keep track of the user's score and provide feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
// The project can include features like a timer for each question, a leaderboard to display high scores, and the ability to add new quiz categories or questions.
// If-else statements can be used to check the correctness of answers, calculate scores, and determine the level of difficulty based on the category or user's performance.
