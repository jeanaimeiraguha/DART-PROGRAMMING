  // Introduction to Switch Case

  // Switch case is a control flow statement in Dart (and many other programming languages) that allows you to select one of many possible code blocks to execute based on the value of a given expression. It provides a concise and efficient way to handle multiple cases or conditions in your code.


  // The switch case statement consists of the following components:

  // Expression: It is a value or variable that is evaluated to determine which code block to execute.

  // Case: Each case represents a specific value or condition that is compared against the expression. If the expression matches a case, the corresponding code block associated with that case is executed.

  // Default: The default case is optional and is used when none of the cases match the expression. It provides a fallback option to execute a code block when no specific match is found.



  // The syntax of a switch case statement in Dart is as follows:

  // switch (expression) {
  //   case value1:
  //     // code block to execute if expression matches value1
  //     break;
  //   case value2:
  //     // code block to execute if expression matches value2
  //     break;
  //   // more cases...
  //   default:
  //     // code block to execute if no cases match the expression
  // }
