  To solve the given assignment question, you need to write a Dart program that checks whether a given set is a subset or superset of another set. Here's an explanation of what needs to be done:

  1. Input: The program should take two sets as input from the user. These two sets will be referred to as Set A and Set B.

  2. Subset Check: You need to check if Set A is a subset of Set B. A set is considered a subset if all of its elements are present in the other set. In other words, every element of Set A should also be present in Set B.

  3. Superset Check: Similarly, you need to check if Set A is a superset of Set B. A set is considered a superset if it contains all the elements of the other set. In this case, all elements of Set B should also be present in Set A.

  4. Display Result: Based on the subset and superset checks, you should display the result to the user. There are three possible outcomes:

    4.1 If Set A is a subset of Set B, display a message indicating that Set A is a subset of Set B.
    4.2 If Set A is a superset of Set B, display a message indicating that Set A is a superset of Set B.
    4.3 If neither of the above conditions is true, display a message indicating that Set A is neither a subset nor a superset of Set B.
  
  
  Remember, sets in Dart are compared based on their elements, so you need to compare the elements of the sets to determine the subset or superset relationship.

  Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you can proceed to implement the Dart code to take input sets, perform the subset and superset checks, and display the appropriate messages based on the comparison results.
