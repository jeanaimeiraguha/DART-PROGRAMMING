  // Introduction to Set

  /*
  
  ***** What is a set? *****

    1. A set is a collection of unique elements where each element occurs only once in the set. 
    
    2. It is an unordered collection, meaning the elements in a set have no specific order.
    
    3. Sets are used when the presence or absence of elements is more important than their order.

    4. Sets are typically used to perform mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
  
    
  ***** Characteristics of sets: *****

    1. Unique Elements: Sets only contain unique elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will be ignored.

    2. Unordered: The elements in a set are not stored in any particular order. The order of elements can change during operations on the set.

    3. Mutable: Sets in Dart are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements from a set.

    4. No Indexing: Unlike lists, sets do not support indexing. You cannot access elements by their position in a set.

    5. Fast Element Lookup: Sets provide fast element lookup because they use hashing to efficiently find elements.


  ***** Key features and use cases of sets: *****

    1. Removing Duplicates: Sets are useful when you have a collection of elements and you want to remove any duplicate values, ensuring each value appears only once.

    2. Set Operations: Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference, which are helpful for solving problems involving comparisons, filtering, and combining data sets.

    3. Membership Testing: Sets provide efficient membership testing. You can quickly check if an element is present in a set.

    4. Data Deduplication: When working with large datasets, sets can be used to eliminate duplicate entries and reduce memory usage.

    5. Mathematical Modeling: Sets are commonly used in mathematical modeling to represent relationships, such as a set of students enrolled in a course or a set of items in a shopping cart.



  Sets are a powerful data structure in Dart that offer unique elements, efficient lookup, and support for mathematical operations. They are widely used in various domains, including data processing, algorithm design, and mathematical modeling. Understanding sets and their characteristics can help in writing efficient and concise code to solve a wide range of problems.
