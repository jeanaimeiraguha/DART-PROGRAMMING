/*
  In Dart, the 'main' function is the entry point of every Dart program. It serves as the starting point for the execution of your code. When you run a Dart program, the execution starts from the main function.

*/

// Here is an example of a simple main function in Dart:

void main(List<String> args) {
  print("Alhamdulillah Run First Dart Program Successfully!");
}

// Congratulations! You have successfully run your first Dart program. You can now continue exploring the Dart language and building more complex applications.


// Now lets explain the written code line by line

/*
  In the above example, the main function is defined with the void return type, indicating that it doesn't return any value. The function name is main, which is a special function name recognized by Dart as the entry point.

  Inside the main function, you can write any code statements that you want to be executed when the program runs. In the example, we have a single code statement that prints the string "Alhamdulillah Run First Dart Program Successfully!" to the console using the print function.

  You can have multiple code statements within the main function, and they will be executed sequentially. The main function can also call other functions or perform various operations.

  It's important to note that the main function must always be defined as the top-level function in your Dart program. It cannot be defined inside another function or class.

  When you run your Dart program, the code within the main function will be executed, and the program will start executing from there.
