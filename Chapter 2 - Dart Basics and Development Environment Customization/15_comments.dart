  // Comments in Dart

  // 1. Comments in programming are lines of code that are ignored by the compiler or interpreter and are used to provide explanatory or descriptive information about the code. 

  // 2. temporarily disabling code without deleting it

  // Comments are intended for developers or other readers of the code and serve several purposes:

  
  // 1.  Documentation : 
  /*   Comments are used to document the code, explaining its purpose, functionality, or usage. They help other developers understand the code more easily, especially when working on collaborative projects or maintaining code written by others. */


  // 2.  Explanation : 
  /*   Comments can be used to provide explanations or clarifications about specific sections of code. They can describe the intent behind a particular implementation choice or provide context for complex algorithms or calculations. */


  // 3.  Disable Code : 
  /*   Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" a section of code without deleting it. This is often done during debugging or testing to isolate problematic code or test alternative solutions. */

  
  // 4.  TODOs and Future Work : 
  /*   Comments can be used to mark areas of code that require further attention or additional work. They act as reminders for developers to come back and make improvements, address issues, or implement new features. */


  // There are two types of commments in dart 
  // 1. Single Line Comments
  // 2. Multi-line comments


  // 1. Single Line Comments
  // These comments start with two forward slashes (//) and continue until the end of the line. Everything after the slashes is ignored by the compiler. For example:

  // This is a single-line comment in Dart

  
  // 2. Multi-line comments
  // These comments start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash (*/). They can span multiple lines. For example:

  /*
  This is a multi-line comment
  in Dart that can span
  across multiple lines
  */


  // Comments are useful for documenting the code, explaining the purpose of functions or variables, providing instructions, or temporarily disabling code without deleting it. They help other developers (including yourself) understand the code's intent and make it easier to maintain and debug in the future.
